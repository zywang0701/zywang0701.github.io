## Abstract

We introduce the R package \CRANpkg{SIHR} for statistical inference in high-dimensional generalized linear models with continuous and binary outcomes. The package provides functionalities for constructing confidence intervals and performing hypothesis tests for low-dimensional objectives in both one-sample and two-sample regression settings. We illustrate the usage of \CRANpkg{SIHR} through numerical examples and present real data applications to demonstrate the package's performance and practicality.
